# Quantum-analysis-of-systems-with-various-potentials-using-Scilab

This repository contains all my work done as a project under Dr. Nilesh Pathak, Maharaja Agrasen College, University of Delhi. The project was done during my last semester of my bachelor degree. 

## Quantum Mechanics 

The fundamental idea of Quantum Mechanics is the quantization. Hence, the name 'Quantum Mechanics'. It started with the assumption of quantization of energy and later paved its way to solve some of the unsolvable problems in physics. Quantum Mechanics had lead us to some of the most astonishing results like quantization of physical observation, wave particle duality, quantum tunneling etc. 

## Scilab

Defined as high-level, numerically oriented programming language, scilab for me is a tool to computationally solve the problems of physics. It is freely available under open source license. Scilab is my first programing language I used solving physics and is the languange which opens my door to computational physics. 

## Programing 

Solving the s-wave Schrodinger equation for the ground state and first excited state of the Hydrogen atom. 
Solving the s-wave radial Schrodinger equation for an atom, using Screened coulomb potential.
Solving the s-wave radial Schrodinger equation for a particle with harmonic oscillator potential.
Solving the s-wave radial Schrodinger equation for the vibration of Hydrogen molecole, using Morse potential. 

## Acknowledgement 

I am so thankful to Dr. Nilesh Pathak for providing me my first taste of computational programing and appriciate its guidance in brightening my knowledge in this domane.
